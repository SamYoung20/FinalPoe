Make sure the Arduinos are hooked between 10 and 11. One wire should be hooked to 10 on one arduino and 11 on the other and the other wire 
vice versa. Make sure the Arduinos are grounded. If you are connecting USBs to the computer, make sure your computer is plugged in.
Make sure your serial window is running the same bauds as they are setup to run.

The drum_test_v6_sense code goes on the Arduino without the motor shield. This is the sense arduino, it is hooked to the circuit and should
be doing the beat detection. 
In order to detect the beat, type 'f' into the Serial.
This code should print: "In findPeriod" when they enter the findPeriod function
Inside the function it should print if the duration on is too low and then print the duration.
Is should then print the duration on when it moves on to detecting duration off. It will also print
the duration off. THese numbers are the time between the sound and the silence of beats.
The period should then be printed, then the average period. It should print period 3 
more times, just from various tests. It should then print the bpm. This number will be the number
sent to the other Arduino.

The drum_test_v9_thinkAct code goes on the Arduino with the motor shield. This is the code that
directs the motor movement. Right now it is set up to beat the foot. To beat the hand,
uncomment the line that has a comment saying, "to run arm, uncomment this one." This code should
run when it recieves from the sense Arduino. When it recieves you will see:
"Recieving
*******************************
bpm"

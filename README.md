# FinalPoe
Gretchen, Elena, Emma, Colvin, and Sam's Final POE project


*Version 1*
  This is the first version of the code written. This version was used to make sure we could turn our motors on for a certain amount of tie and then release them for a certain amount of time. With a rubber badn, this allowed us to beat a constant beat. **This code works with the first version of the mechanical system.**


*Version 2*
  This version includes user input. The beat is still a constant, set beat. However, using user input the rhythm played changes between 7 different rhythms. **This code works with the first version of the mechanical system.**


*Version 3*
  This version has the first beat detection. When the user tells it to, it will listen and detect the beat. With this beat it will play a set rhythm. **This code works with the first version of the mechanical system.** 


*Version 4*
  This version is the same as version 3, except it has a logic statement to determine the rhythm it plays. It determines the bpm and based on that it selects a rhythm to play. **This code works with the first version of the mechanical system.** 


*Version 5*
  This version is the same as version 4 except it is used with the geared mechanical system. **This code works with the second version of the mechanical system.** 


*Version 6*
  This version is the first to use two Arduinos. This should allow us to listen to a beat while playing. The "Sense" Arduino does the listening and determines the period. The "Think/Act" Arduino determines the bpm from the period it is sent from the "Sense" Arduino and tells the drummer to play. **This code works with the first version of the mechanical system.**
